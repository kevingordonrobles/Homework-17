                        <h1> Hello, I am Kevin Gordon Robles, a freelance UX/UI designer.</h1>
                        <p>I specialize in UX research. My skills include a specialty in using Figma, Miro, Invision, and Github, I have worked as a UX researcher and UX/UI designer in past projects.
                            One the main aspects of design that attracted me is problem solving. Iâ€™ve always been a critical thinker so using design to solve real problems is truly enjoyable for me.
                            I am originally from Puerto Rico but I moved to Minnesota when I was 5 years old. I graduated from the University of Minnesota with a Communications degree. After graduating I moved to Japan to teach English for a year. Currently enrolled UX/UI Bootcamp at the University of Minnesota I can also speak Spanish and a bit of Japanese
